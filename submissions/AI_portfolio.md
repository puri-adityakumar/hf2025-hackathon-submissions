## Project Title

AI Portfolio

## Project Description

An AI-first portfolio that transforms how visitors learn about you. Instead of static pages, they can chat with an assistant that knows your background, skills, projects, and experience.

## Inspiration behind the Project

Instead of scrolling through sections, I wanted visitors to explore my story through dynamic conversationsâ€”more engaging, memorable, and tailored to what they care about.
