## Project Title

CLARIQ

## Project Description

Clariq is your AI-powered sales research partner that delivers clear, actionable insights on prospects, markets, and opportunitiesâ€”helping you close smarter, faster, and with confidence. It automates data collection, synthesizes findings using state-of-the-art AI, and turns them into concise, decision-ready briefs. Use it from the web app or programmatically via the API to trigger research jobs, track progress, and retrieve structured results.

## Inspiration behind the Project

Sales research is slow, manual, and scattered across many tools â€” a huge bottleneck for reps who need fast, reliable context to have confident conversations. We created CLARIQ to automate that work: it collects multi-source data, uses advanced AI summarization to surface the most relevant signals, and packages the results into concise, decision-ready briefs. By combining async job orchestration, secure sessions, and voice-enabled workflows, CLARIQ lets teams trigger and retrieve actionable research programmatically or via the web UI, reducing time-to-insight and improving conversion rates.
