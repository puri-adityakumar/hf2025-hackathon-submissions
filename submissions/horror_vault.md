## Project Title

Horror Vault

## Project Description

Horror Vault is a Halloween-focused movie recommendation site that cuts through endless, confusing lists. Choose your moodâ€”creepy, gory, classic, or campyâ€”and get curated picks so you can press play faster.

## Inspiration behind the Project

Long, crowded recommendation lists make picking a horror movie tedious. Horror Vault was inspired by that decision fatigueâ€”offering quick, mood-based suggestions so you spend less time scrolling and more time watching.
